# Pharmaceutical Marketing Material Generator

## Intro

This tool will generate marketing materials for the pharmaceutical industry.
It consists of a Flask backend, that will generate prompts that are sent to an LLM, and return marketing copy;
and a Streamlit front end, that will accept user inputs and display results.

The front end, and API for this project are trivial and will not be discussed in detail.

A notebook outlining the prompt and content generation process can be found here:
